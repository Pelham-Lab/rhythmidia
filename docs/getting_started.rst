Getting Started
===============


Installation and Program Launch
---------------
1. Rhythmidia must be installed in a Python environment running Python 3.11 or higher using pip. Rhythmidia runs on Unix-like operating systems including macOS and Linux. In order to install Rhythmidia, simply run the command: 
.. code-block:: console

$ pip install rhythmidia

2. To run Rhythmidia run the command
.. code-block:: console
    
    pip install rhythmidia


NOTE: The terminal window used to launch Rhythmidia must remain open while the program is in use.

Rhythmidia Right Out of the Box
---------------
1. The first time you open a new installation of the program, you will be prompted to select a working directory. From this directory, the program will, by default, look for race tube images, and will by default, save data<br />
    a. This can be changed later at any time<br />
    b. You are not restricted to using this directory, it is purely for your convenience<br />
    c. This is where analysis data will be exported by default<br />
2. Thatâ€™s it! You can start analyzing images immediately.
NOTE: On some newer Mac laptops with variable-force-click trackpads, you may find that some clicks are not picked up effectively unless you click with full force.

.. code-block:: python
    
    import rhythmidia
